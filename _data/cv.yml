    - title: "Software Engineering Intern"
      institution: Google Cloud
      year: May 2019 - Aug 2019
      description:
        - Worked with David Cohen at Google Cloud to develop DapperMC, a probabilistic pro-gramming library tailored to modeling Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Google engineers now use DapperMC to obtain a statistical understanding of datacenter performance, detect anomalous machines, and benchmark the effects of software updates on RPC latency.
